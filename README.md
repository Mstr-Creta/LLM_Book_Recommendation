# Building a Semantic Book Recommender with LLMs 

* Text data cleaning
* Semantic (vector) search and how to build a vector database. This allows users to find the most similar books to a natural language query (e.g., "a book about a person seeking revenge").
* Doing text classification using zero-shot classification in LLMs. This allows us to classify the books as "fiction" or "non-fiction", creating a facet that users can filter the books on. 
* Doing sentiment analysis using LLMs and extracting the emotions from text.
* Creating a web application using Gradio for users to get book recommendations.
